## Simplifies Luggage Management During Vacations
Many travelers encounter difficulties in managing their belongings while on vacation, often leading to misplaced or lost items. Our team is motivated to address this problem by developing a solution that helps travelers ensure the safety of their belongings and enhances their vacation planning experience. To maximize efficiency when preparing for a vacation, FindToFine, a mobile app with the primary purpose is to streamline the process of scanning list of belongings before embarking on a vacation trip. Without the app, users face the inconvenience of manually listing their items, potentially leading to oversight and disorganization. Whereas the application simplifies this task by allowing users to simply take a photo of their belongings. FindtoFine is a mobile application that functions to create a list of a user's holiday luggage, by simply taking photos of the items they bring without making a list manually.
